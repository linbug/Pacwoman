PacWoman

This is my first attempt at coding a keyboard directed game in Processing.

Other repos include sketches for [maze creation](https://github.com/linbug/Maze_for_PacWoman) (see this repo for the most up-to-date version)and [AI enemy generation] (https://github.com/linbug/Enemies_for_PacWoman).

Loosely based on another famous game with a similar title. 

(I started this project before I realised I had unwittingly enacted a [common video game trope.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYqYLfm1rWA) D'oh!)
